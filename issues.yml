wagmi + solana

- connected with sample wallet (supports ethereum, solana)
- connected to ethereum chain
- switch to solana chain
- refresh page
- when page load;
  - initialize UPA
  - 


wagmi adapter can:
- switch chain from appkit, while UPA cannot
- listen to chain change events from wallet, while UPA cannot


wagmi issues:
- after refreshing page, it's not connecting me again (this is happening if we add solana chain to `caipNetworks`)
- if user set evm + solana chains, then switch to solana chain, they shouldn't be able to call wagmi methods
  - should we throw errors or users should be aware
- after switching to solana and back to ethereum, sign message works, but switching to optimisim (which is evm) doesn't work
  - repro: when we switch chain from appkit, wagmi methods throw ChainMismatchError
